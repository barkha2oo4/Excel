# Student Persona Analysis and Performance Dashboard

This project analyzes student performance data from a questionnaire designed to assess innovative thinking and learning styles. Students are categorized into four distinct personas based on their responses, and the findings are presented in an interactive dashboard format.

## Project Goals

* To categorize students into meaningful personas based on their responses to a questionnaire.
* To visualize the distribution of these personas and their performance across different questions.
* To provide insights into student learning styles and innovative thinking.
* To facilitate connections between students with similar personas.
